        Our shops remain open from Monday to Saturday 9.00AM to 5.30PM

Our repair services are operating as normal, however if you are self isolating and need supplies, collection or delivery of items this can be arranged as well.  We can also take payment over the phone and arrange a contactless delivery.

For system and peripheral sales we would ask you call first for sales and collection advice.

Online sales are operating as normal.

For protection we have on counter cough screens and hand sanitisers in store and ask for customers to mind social distancing regulations.

We want to keep our colleagues visiting customersâ€™ homes safe, and with that in mind, they are supplied with face masks and sanitisers and will be very happy to assist with any requirements you may have, to help you feel secure whilst they are in your home or work place.

WE LOOK FOWARD TO SEEING YOU SOON.
